I will eventually clean up the .Rmd file containing the back-end analysis for this project to this repository, but for the time being, the repository contains the building blocks for an interactive visualization highlighting the overrepresentation of tribal police departments among Washington law enforcement agencies that have hired officers with a prior termination or resignation in lieu of termination in their employment history.

I used the d3.js library to build the visualization, and it still requires some fine-tuning before it is publication-ready.
